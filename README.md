    - They can create new events with details such as the name, date, venue, and description.
    - If event details change, admins can edit or update existing events.
    - After the event, they can declare the winners by uploading results, which are visible to students.

2. **Student Workflow**:
    - Students can log in to their dashboard to view a list of upcoming sports events.
    - The "Events" page allows them to see event descriptions, schedules, and details.
